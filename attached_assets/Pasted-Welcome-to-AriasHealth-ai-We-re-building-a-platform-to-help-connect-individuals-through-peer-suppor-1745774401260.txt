Welcome to AriasHealth.ai! Weâ€™re building a platform to help connect individuals through peer support and wellness-focused groups.
 This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information as we grow.

Your name


Your email address


Your interests or service affiliation (for matching into groups)


Any feedback you choose to provide through surveys or forms


We also collect general technical info (like device type and browser type) to help improve the site.

We take privacy seriously and use reasonable measures to protect your information.
 That said, AriasHealth.ai is still in its early development phase, and no online system is 100% guaranteed secure.
