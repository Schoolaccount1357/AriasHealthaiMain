I have uploaded a new image titled **Peertopeer.jpg**. This image must appear as the **background on the left side** of the hero section on the homepage.

---

### What I NEED:

1. **Set "Peertopeer.jpg" as the left-side hero image**
   - The image should appear clearly and fully—do NOT crop or hide the group
   - The image should be placed inside the hero section container (as a `background-image` or `<img>` depending on structure)
   - If using Tailwind: use `object-cover w-full h-full` for image styling
   - Use responsive layout so the image adjusts on all screen sizes

2. **Fix the missing image issue**
   - Right now, the hero section appears with a blank or solid navy background — that’s incorrect
   - This means the image path is either:
     - Wrong
     - Not properly linked
     - Not recognized in the build
   - Please verify:
     - The image file is in the correct public path (e.g., `/public/Peertopeer.jpg`)
     - The file name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
     - You’re referencing it properly in the JSX/CSS (e.g., `background-image: url('/Peertopeer.jpg')` or `<img src="/Peertopeer.jpg">`)

3. **Maintain gradient + layout integrity**
   - Keep the right side with the **dark navy background** (`#0F172A`)
   - Add a **left-to-right gradient** that blends the image into the right-side text:
     - CSS: `linear-gradient(to right, #0F172A 0%, rgba(15,23,42,0.8) 40%, transparent 100%)`
     - Layer it using `::before`, `z-index`, or an absolutely positioned `div`

4. **Text block stays the same**
   - The section with:
     - `You are not alone.`
     - Button + Early Access text
   - Should remain on the right and aligned properly with the image

5. **Responsiveness**
   - Ensure the image displays cleanly on desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints
   - Use Tailwind or media queries to prevent distortion or cropping

6. **Document all changes**
   - Note which file contains the image path
   - Note if any layout components, tailwind classes, or custom CSS were changed
   - Save notes in `Instructions.md`

This task is to replace the **hero background with the Peertopeer.jpg image**, fix the missing image issue, and ensure proper blend + responsiveness. No further layout redesigns needed.
