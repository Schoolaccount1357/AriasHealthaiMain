I want to polish the homepage hero section to improve visual clarity, mobile responsiveness, and overall composition. The current layout is close, but it needs stronger cohesion across screen sizes. Please make the following changes:

---

1. **Blend Image into Background (Gradient Overlay)**
   - Add a smooth **left-to-right gradient** overlay on top of the hero image.
   - Use Tailwind or CSS gradient like:
     `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F172A] via-[#0F172A]/80 to-transparent`
   - Apply this as a `::before` pseudo-element or `absolute` overlay `div` with appropriate `z-index`.
   - The gradient must:
     - Start fully opaque on the left edge
     - Fade naturally across the image (not a hard edge)
     - Sit above the image but beneath the text

---

2. **Zoom Out the Hero Image**
   - Adjust image container settings so the **entire group is visible** in the frame.
   - Use `object-fit: cover` or control the background image scale as needed.
   - Ensure it does not clip or distort important elements like faces or posture.

3. **Align Hero Section Height with Image**
   - The **bottom edge of the hero container** (dark blue section with text) should align perfectly with the **bottom of the image**.
   - Avoid awkward excess padding or mismatched height that causes layout imbalance.
   - Both image and text block should share equal vertical height at all screen sizes.

4. **Ensure Mobile Responsiveness**
   - All changes should work cleanly across mobile devices:
     - iPhone SE / 12 / 14
     - Android Galaxy S series
     - Tablet widths (e.g., 768px, 1024px)
   - Specifically:
     - Gradient should scale proportionally and not overwhelm smaller screens
     - Text should stay readable and well-spaced (adjust padding/margins with Tailwind breakpoints like `sm:pt-8`, `md:pt-12`, etc.)
     - Image must maintain full width and proper scaling (`w-full h-auto object-cover`)

5. **Documentation**
   - Document all classNames, container changes, and responsive adjustments in a file called `Instructions.md`.
