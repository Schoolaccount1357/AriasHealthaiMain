# Hero Section Image Replacement and Gradient Refinements

## Modified Files
- `client/src/components/home/Hero.tsx`: Replaced hero image with new peer support image and enhanced gradient overlays.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hero Image Replacement
- Replaced the previous hero image with a new peer support group image:
  - Changed image import from `veterans-group.png` to `@assets/Peer to peer .png`
  - Updated alt text to: "Veterans engaged in a peer support group discussion"
  - Adjusted positioning to properly frame the conversation circle

### 2. Enhanced Image Clarity and Brightness
- Fine-tuned image settings for better visibility of all group members:
  - Increased brightness: `brightness-[1.15]` (up from 1.12)
  - Enhanced contrast: `contrast-[1.08]` (up from 1.05)
  - Applied additional brightness with overlay: `bg-white opacity-[0.03] mix-blend-overlay`
  - Optimized vertical positioning with: `md:object-[center_45%]` to center the group

### 3. Improved Gradient Alignment at Top and Bottom
- Created smoother top-to-bottom gradients with a three-stage blend:
  - Increased gradient height to 20% of container: `h-[20%]` (previously 1/6)
  - Added middle transition point with `via-` syntax: 
    ```css
    from-[#0F172A]/60 via-[#0F172A]/30 to-transparent
    ```
  - Used consistent gradient opacity and size at both top and bottom for alignment

### 4. Better Side-to-Side Blending
- Refined horizontal gradient transitions:
  - Main gradient: `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F172A]/90 via-[#0F172A]/60 to-transparent`
  - Expanded right side blend: `w-1/3 bg-gradient-to-l from-[#141e2f]/40 via-[#141e2f]/20 to-transparent`
  - Used multi-step gradients with via points for smoother transitions
  - Maintained proper layering with z-index control

### 5. Responsive Design Considerations
- Ensured image displays properly across all screen sizes:
  - Mobile heights: `h-[280px] sm:h-[340px]`
  - Desktop scaling: `scale-100 md:scale-100` (removed scaling reduction)
  - Maintained progressive container height system: `min-h-[450px] sm:min-h-[480px] md:min-h-[520px] lg:min-h-[550px]`
  - Used absolute positioning for proper image alignment: `md:absolute md:inset-y-0 md:left-0 md:w-1/2`

### 6. Asset Information
- **New Image**: `Peer to peer .png` (from `attached_assets/`)
- **Image Styling**: 
  ```css
  w-full h-full object-cover object-center md:object-[center_45%] scale-100 md:scale-100 brightness-[1.15] contrast-[1.08]
  ```
- **Gradient Implementation**: Layered divs with improved via-point gradients for smoother transitions

These changes create a more authentic representation of the peer support experience with the new image, while ensuring the gradients provide balanced framing without obscuring any faces. The multi-point gradients create more natural transitions at all edges of the image.
