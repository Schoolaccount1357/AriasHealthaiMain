# Visual Hierarchy and Flow Improvements - Hero Section

## Modified Files
- `client/src/components/home/Hero.tsx`: Enhanced the hero section with improved spacing, gradient overlays, and responsive design.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Vertical Spacing
- Increased overall container heights: `min-h-[520px] md:min-h-[580px]`
- Added gap between flex items: `gap-8 md:gap-12 lg:gap-16`
- Increased padding around text content: `py-16 md:py-20 lg:py-24`
- Progressive padding based on screen sizes: `px-6 sm:px-8 lg:px-10`
- Improved left padding for text content on medium screens and up: `md:pl-12 lg:pl-16 xl:pl-20`
- Increased spacing between elements: 
  - Larger margins for heading: `mb-6 md:mb-8 lg:mb-10`
  - Increased paragraph spacing: `mb-8 md:mb-10`

### 2. Added Gradient Overlay
- Implemented a multi-layered gradient approach for more refined blending:
  - Horizontal gradient from solid navy to transparent: `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F172A] via-transparent to-transparent`
  - Vertical gradient for bottom fade: `bg-gradient-to-t from-[#141e2f] via-[#141e2f]/40 to-transparent`
  - Right-side gradient for text area blending: `bg-gradient-to-l from-[#141e2f] to-transparent`
  - Added subtle vignette effect: `bg-[#0F172A] opacity-20 mix-blend-multiply`
- Controlled opacity layers for different screen sizes
- Ensured proper z-index placement (z-10) to sit on top of the image but behind text (z-20)

### 3. Improved Responsiveness
- Increased image height on mobile: `h-[320px] sm:h-[380px]`
- Progressive spacing system based on breakpoints
- Maintained visual separation at all screen sizes
- Added transition effect to image: `transition-all duration-500`

### 4. Overall Design Enhancement
- Added detailed comments to mark content sections
- Improved semantic structure with clear component organization
- Maintained existing content positioning
- Enhanced overall visual polish while preserving the original design intent
