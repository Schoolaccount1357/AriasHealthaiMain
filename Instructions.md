# Hero Section Image and Visual Improvements

## Modified Files
- `client/src/components/home/Hero.tsx`: Enhanced the hero section with improved image clarity, gradient overlays, and responsive design.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Image Clarity and Brightness
- Adjusted contrast and brightness of the hero image so group members are clearly visible:
  - Increased brightness adjustment: `brightness-[1.12]`
  - Enhanced contrast slightly: `contrast-[1.05]`
  - Applied additional brightness with overlay: `bg-white opacity-[0.03] mix-blend-overlay`
  - Added subtle highlight gradient: `bg-gradient-to-b from-white/5 to-white/0 mix-blend-overlay opacity-30`

### 2. Zoomed Out the Image to Show More of the Group
- Reduced scaling to reveal more of the group and emphasize group dynamic:
  - Changed from original scaling to `scale-100 md:scale-[0.98]`
  - Centered image vertically and horizontally: `object-center md:object-[center_center]`
  - Maintained proper proportions with: `object-cover object-center`
  - Ensured image fills container with responsive heights: `h-[280px] sm:h-[340px] md:h-full`

### 3. Balanced Gradient Overlay for Both Sides
- Implemented sophisticated gradients that don't obscure faces while providing balanced blending:
  - Main left-to-right gradient: `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0F172A]/90 via-[#0F172A]/60 to-transparent`
  - Added right side gradient for text blending: `inset-y-0 right-0 w-1/4 bg-gradient-to-l from-[#141e2f]/30 to-transparent`
  - Created top-bottom alignment: 
    ```css
    inset-x-0 top-0 h-1/6 bg-gradient-to-b from-[#0F172A]/40 to-transparent
    inset-x-0 bottom-0 h-1/6 bg-gradient-to-t from-[#0F172A]/40 to-transparent
    ```
  - Used proper z-index for all overlays: `z-10` (below text content which is `z-20`)

### 4. Enhanced Responsiveness and Alignment
- Ensured consistent alignment at top and bottom edges:
  - Added matching top and bottom gradient overlays with equal height (`h-1/6`)
  - Set specific mobile heights: `h-[280px] sm:h-[340px]`
  - Used absolute positioning on larger screens: `md:absolute md:inset-y-0 md:left-0`
  - Created container heights that grow with screen size: `min-h-[450px] sm:min-h-[480px] md:min-h-[520px] lg:min-h-[550px]`

### 5. Asset Information
- **Image Used**: `veterans-group.png` (from `src/assets/`)
- **Image Styling**: 
  ```css
  w-full h-full object-cover object-center md:object-[center_center] scale-100 md:scale-[0.98] brightness-[1.12] contrast-[1.05]
  ```
- **Gradient Implementation**: Multiple layered absolutely positioned divs with z-index control
- **Container Structure**: Flex column on mobile, flex row with absolute image positioning on medium screens and up

These changes collectively make the hero image more vibrant and human-centered, with better visibility of faces and improved blending on both sides. The consistent top-to-bottom alignment creates a more cohesive look, while the more balanced gradients ensure the image is visible without being obscured.
