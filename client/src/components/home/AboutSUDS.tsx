          Many Veterans face isolation, stigma, and barriers to care â€” especially in substance use recovery.
          Traditional services don't always meet them where they are.

          <li>Limited access to timely mental health support</li>
          <li>Difficulty connecting with peers who truly understand their experiences</li>
